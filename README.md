## 📂 Projects

### 🔹 Security Principles Study
> Studied foundational cybersecurity concepts including **Information Security**, the **CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**, and the **DAD Triad (Disclosure, Alteration, Denial)**.  
> Explored security models such as **Bell-LaPadula, Biba, Clark-Wilson, and Brewer-Nash**, and strategies like **Defense in Depth** and **Zero Trust**.  
> Learned the differences between **Threats, Risks, and Attacks**, and how layered defenses reduce vulnerabilities.

### 🔹 Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
> Gained knowledge of **Governance, Regulation, and Compliance frameworks** in cybersecurity.  
> Studied international standards such as **GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, and NIST 800-53**.  
> Learned how organizations develop governance documents, risk management procedures, and compliance programs to protect sensitive data.  
> Explored real-world applications like **remote work security policies** and **financial sector GRC frameworks**.

### 🔹 Cyber Kill Chain
> Studied the **Cyber Kill Chain framework** developed by Lockheed Martin, which outlines the 7 stages of a cyber attack:  
> **Reconnaissance → Weaponization → Delivery → Exploitation → Installation → Command & Control → Actions on Objectives**.  
> Learned how attackers use techniques like phishing, infected USBs, watering hole attacks, and persistence methods (web shells, backdoors, registry modifications).  
> Reflected on how defenders can break the chain at each stage, and compared the traditional Kill Chain with modern frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK**.
